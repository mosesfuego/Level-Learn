# UnityED.ai
📚 Project Name: UnityED.ai – Adaptive Education for Every Learner
🌍 The Mission
LearnLoop is an adaptive learning platform built to support homeschooled students, learners in under-resourced communities, and independent students worldwide. Our goal is to democratize access to quality education by offering a free, intelligent, and responsive platform that evolves with each learner.

We believe every student deserves a learning experience that adapts to them—not the other way around.

🎯 The Problem
Homeschooling families and students in low-income or developing regions often lack structured feedback, clear progression, or access to tutoring.

Most ed-tech platforms are built for traditional classrooms or paid ecosystems, leaving millions behind.

Students also forget what they don’t revisit, and most systems don’t remind them or adapt accordingly.

💡 The Solution
LearnLoop gives each learner a smart learning account that:

Tracks what they’ve mastered, what they’re learning, and what they may have forgotten

Suggests the next topics based on performance and pre-requisites

Reminds them to review material before it fades from memory

Connects them with curated learning resources (videos, exercises, articles)

It's like a private tutor that grows with the student—simple, accessible, and scalable.

🛠️ Hackathon MVP Features
Subject selector (e.g. middle school math to start)

Mini diagnostics: Quick GPT-generated quizzes to assess current knowledge

Personalized learning map: Shows mastered, learning, and review-needed topics

Adaptive learning engine: Recommends next lessons or skills to build

Content delivery: Links to free resources (Khan Academy, YouTube, OpenStax)

Offline-friendly mode (stretch goal)

⚙️ Tech Stack (Proposed)
Frontend: React or Swift (depending on target device)

Backend: Firebase or Supabase for storage and auth

AI/NLP: GPT-4 for quiz generation, topic explanations, and dynamic feedback

Graph/Modeling: Lightweight in-memory or JSON-based learner model

Content Layer: APIs or manual embeds of open educational content

❤️ Why It Matters
Designed for self-learners, not school systems

Empowers homeschoolers, refugees, low-income families, and disconnected learners

Makes adaptive, feedback-driven learning available to anyone, anywhere

Promotes long-term mastery—not just short-term scores
